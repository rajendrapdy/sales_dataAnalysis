The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable business insights from the sales dataset through a structured analytical approach. This involves evaluating overall sales performance to identify high-performing products, customer segments, and geographical regions. The analysis also focuses on understanding revenue distribution across different product categories and locations, which can help in strategic decision-making. Additionally, a time series analysis is conducted to uncover sales patterns, seasonality, and long-term trends, enabling more accurate forecasting and better planning for future sales strategies.
This analysis was conducted using the Python programming language within the Visual Studio Code environment. The data manipulation and preprocessing tasks were primarily handled using the pandas library, which provided powerful capabilities for cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, grouping data, and performing time-based resampling. Numerical operations were supported by numpy, while visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn to produce insightful charts such as bar plots, pie charts, and line graphs. Date formatting and manipulation were essential to enable time series analysis, allowing for monthly and yearly trend identification. The warnings library was used to suppress unnecessary system alerts, ensuring a cleaner and more focused analysis environment. Together, these tools enabled a robust exploration of sales performance across various dimensions including geography, product categories, and time.
